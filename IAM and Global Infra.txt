Implicit allow : We can access the resources based on the allocated policy only. If you are trying to access another services, it wont allow. 

Explicit Deny : If you deny a service once, If you allow 100 times also, deny will take effect. 

Requirement : IAM user need AdministratorAccess, But i dont want to allow access on "S3 Service".

IAM User with Administartor access = root user without account management permissions

Policy : Document that contains set of permissions on AWS env.
--> AWS Managed JOb Function
--> AWS managed policy
--> Customer managed policy

We cannot delete AWS managed polocies. 

==> Deny will always have highest priority. 
YOu allow a service 100 times, but denied 1 time = DENY


Credential report : Gives report on all IAM user and their pwd last used and pwd age.

arn : Amazon Resource Name : arn:aws:iam::501170964283:user/AdminUser
